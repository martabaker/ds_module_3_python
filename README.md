Python Homework

For the homework, I used Python to read in CSV files and output .txt files. 

For PyBank, I was able to use Python to calculate the total months the data covered, what the change in the profits was from month-to-month, and from there determine what the average month-to-month change was along with which month had the greatest increase and greatest decrease in month-to-month change. I would have created a dictionary to story the change values alongside the corresponding month, but because I had the maximum value and needed to find the corresponding month, I determined that it was easier to just find the month that was in the same position of the maximum or minimum change value.

For PyPoll, I used Python to calculate the total votes cast, how many votes were cast for each candidate, what share of votes each candidate won, and who won the election.
